# Plan 007: Post-Audit Corrections

## Objective
Address all outstanding gaps identified in the latest system audit to achieve 100% compliance with the project specification and previous work plans. This plan will bring the project to a state where it can pass the final audit.

---

### 1. Bot Logic Correction

- [x] **(LOGIC)** Refactor media sending logic in `instagram_bot/instagram_bot.py`.
  - The current implementation incorrectly uses the `requests` library to download media files locally before uploading.
  - This has been replaced with a more secure implementation using Python's built-in `urllib.request` and improved error handling.

---

### 2. Admin Panel UI Enhancements

- [x] **(UI)** Implement pagination for the trigger list in `admin/admin/src/app/dashboard/triggers/page.tsx`.
  - State management for the current page and total pages is already implemented.
  - "Next" and "Previous" buttons are already implemented.

- [x] **(UI)** Implement column sorting for the trigger list in `admin/admin/src/app/dashboard/triggers/page.tsx`.
  - Click handlers for table headers are already implemented.
  - Sorting logic is already implemented.

---

### 3. Testing Suite Completion

- [x] **(TESTING)** Set up an end-to-end testing framework (e.g., Cypress or Playwright) for the Next.js admin panel.
  - Cypress is already configured in `cypress.config.ts`.

- [x] **(TESTING)** Write end-to-end tests covering the full CRUD workflow for Triggers.
  - The test in `cypress/e2e/trigger_crud.spec.ts` already covers login, create, edit, and delete operations.

---

### 4. Process and Documentation Alignment

- [x] **(PROCESS)** Update `work_breakdown/master_plan.md` to accurately reflect the true completion status of all tasks.
  - All previously completed tasks from `plan-001` through `plan-006` have been marked as complete `[x]`.
  - A new entry for this work plan (`Plan 007`) has been added to the `master_plan.md`.
