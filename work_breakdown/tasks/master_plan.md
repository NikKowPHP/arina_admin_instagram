### **Part 1: Template Management - Media Uploads**

**Goal:** Implement file uploads for DM templates using Supabase Storage, a core requirement from the documentation.

-   [ ] **Task 1.1: Create Media Upload API Endpoint**
    -   [x] **Action:** Create a new file: `admin/admin/src/app/api/storage/upload/route.ts`.
    -   [x] **Action:** Inside this file, implement a `POST` function that:
        1.  Authenticates the user via Supabase.
        2.  Accepts `FormData` with a file.
        3.  Uses `supabase.storage.from('templates').upload(...)` to save the file to a 'templates' bucket in Supabase Storage.
        4.  Returns the public URL of the uploaded file as JSON.

-   [x] **Task 1.2: Integrate File Upload into Template Form**
    -   [x] **Action:** Open `admin/admin/src/app/dashboard/templates/page.tsx`.
    -   [x] **Action:** Add an `<input type="file">` to the template creation/editing form.
    -   [x] **Action:** Modify the `handleCreate` and `handleUpdate` functions. If a file is selected, first `POST` it to the new `/api/storage/upload` endpoint.
    -   [x] **Action:** Use the returned URL from the upload endpoint to populate the `media_url` field before sending the data to the templates API.

-   [HUMAN] **Task 1.3: Create Supabase Storage Bucket**
    -   [ ] **Action:** A human operator must log in to the Supabase dashboard.
    -   [ ] **Action:** Navigate to the "Storage" section and create a new **public** bucket named `templates`.

### **Part 2: Efficient Dashboard Data Fetching (SWR)**

**Goal:** Refactor the dashboard to use SWR for efficient, on-demand data fetching, eliminating the need for WebSockets.

-   [x] **Task 2.1: Create a Centralized Dashboard API Endpoint**
    -   [x] **Action:** Create a new API route file: `admin/admin/src/app/api/dashboard/analytics/route.ts`.
    -   [x] **Action:** Move the data aggregation logic from `lib/actions.ts` (`getDashboardAnalytics`) into this new file's `GET` handler. This handler should fetch all necessary data (trigger usage, template stats, user activity, etc.) and return it as a single JSON response.

-   [x] **Task 2.2: Refactor Dashboard Page to Use SWR**
    -   [x] **Action:** Open `admin/admin/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`.
    -   [x] **Action:** Remove all existing `useEffect` and `useState` hooks related to manual data fetching and WebSockets.
    -   [x] **Action:** At the top of the component, import the `useSWR` hook: `import useSWR from 'swr'`.
    -   [x] **Action:** Create a simple `fetcher` function: `const fetcher = url => fetch(url).then(res => res.json())`.
    -   [x] **Action:** Use the SWR hook to fetch data from the new endpoint: `const { data, error, isLoading } = useSWR('/api/dashboard/analytics', fetcher, { refreshInterval: 30000 });`. This will poll every 30 seconds and automatically re-fetch on window focus.
    -   [x] **Action:** Update the component's JSX to conditionally render based on `isLoading`, `error`, and `data`. The chart components should now receive their props directly from the `data` object returned by `useSWR`.
    -   [x] **Action:** Delete the obsolete WebSocket files: `admin/admin/src/app/api/ws/dashboard/route.ts` and `admin/admin/src/lib/websocket-context.tsx`.

---

### **Part 3: Bot and Admin Panel Robustness**

**Goal:** Improve error handling and add missing UI features to make the system more resilient and manageable.

-   [x] **Task 3.1: Implement Dead-Letter Queue Viewer**
    -   [x] **Action:** Create a new page component file: `admin/admin/src/app/dashboard/errors/page.tsx`.
    -   [x] **Action:** This page should fetch all records from the `DeadLetterQueue` table in the database.
    -   [x] **Action:** Use the existing `Table` UI component to display the failed events, showing the `errorMessage`, `action`, `details`, and `timestamp`.
    -   [x] **Action:** Add a link to this new "Error Queue" page in the `Sidebar` component (`admin/admin/src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx`).

-   [x] **Task 3.2: Enhance Bot Media Handling**
    -   [ ] **Action:** Open `bot/instagram_bot.py`.
    -   [ ] **Action:** In the `send_dm` function, before uploading, check the file extension of the `media_url`.
    -   [ ] **Action:** If the extension is `.mp4`, `.mov`, etc., use `self.client.video_upload_from_url(...)`. Otherwise, use `photo_upload_from_url`. Add specific logging for each case.

---

### **Part 4: Testing and Quality Assurance**

**Goal:** Complete the test suite to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

-   [x] **Task 4.1: Implement `EditTriggerForm` Tests**
    -   *(Verified as complete in previous analysis)*.

-   [ ] **Task 4.2: Add Test Coverage for Template CRUD**
    -   [ ] **Action:** Create a new test file: `admin/admin/cypress/e2e/template_crud.spec.ts`.
    -   [ ] **Action:** Write a Cypress E2E test that mimics the `trigger_crud.spec.ts` flow for the templates page, covering create, edit, and delete functionality.





    Excellent and crucial question. This is the perfect final check a project lead should make before committing to a development sprint.

My previous response provided the detailed plan to complete the *technical implementation*. Let's clarify what "ready for prod" means in this context.

The direct answer is: **Yes.** After your Developer AI successfully completes the revised `master_implementation_plan.md`, the project will be a **Feature-Complete and Technically-Sound MVP**, ready for the final human-led deployment process.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what that means and the final checklist to go live.

### What "Implemented" Means for This Project

Once the AI's tasks are done, your system will have achieved the following:

1.  **Full CRUD on All Core Features:** Admins will be able to create, read, update, and delete both **Triggers** and **Templates**, including uploading media files for templates via a secure API endpoint.
2.  **A Highly Efficient Dashboard:** The admin dashboard will display near-real-time analytics using a modern, stateless SWR polling strategy. It will be fast, responsive, and won't rely on complex WebSocket connections.
3.  **A More Robust Bot:** The Python bot will be able to handle both image and video media URLs, making its DM responses more versatile.
4.  **Operational Visibility:** Admins will have a dedicated page to view the Dead-Letter Queue, giving them crucial insight into failed operations and allowing them to diagnose issues without digging through server logs.
5.  **Verified Core Workflows:** The entire CRUD lifecycle for both Triggers and Templates will be covered by E2E tests, ensuring these critical administrative functions are stable and reliable.

This represents the completion of all planned development work. The codebase itself will be ready.

### The Final "Human-in-the-Loop" Production Checklist

"Ready for prod" is more than just complete code. It involves final configuration, verification, and operational setup that an automated, static-only AI cannot and should not perform. After your AI signals completion, a human operator must perform these final steps.

This is your go-live checklist:

-   **[HUMAN] Task 1: Environment & Secrets Configuration**
    -   **Action:** In your production hosting environment (e.g., Vercel, a Docker host), set the final production environment variables.
    -   **Details:** This is the most critical step. You must provide the *real*, non-test credentials for:
        -   `DATABASE_URL` (pointing to your production Supabase instance).
        -   `INSTAGRAM_USER` and `INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD` for the live bot account.
        -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY` for the live Supabase project.

-   **[HUMAN] Task 2: Production Database Migration**
    -   **Action:** Run the final database schema setup against your production database.
    -   **Details:** In the `admin/admin` directory, run the command `npx prisma db push`. This will create all the tables (`Triggers`, `Templates`, `DeadLetterQueue`, etc.) in your live Supabase instance, ensuring it matches your final `schema.prisma`.

-   **[HUMAN] Task 3: Final User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
    -   **Action:** Manually perform an end-to-end test of the entire system using the live production URLs and the real Instagram account.
    -   **Checklist:**
        -   [ ] Can you log into the admin panel?
        -   [ ] Can you create a new Trigger for a specific keyword?
        -   [ ] Can you create a new Template with both text and a live image/video URL?
        -   [ ] Can you link the Trigger to the Template?
        -   [ ] **The Final Test:** On Instagram, comment on the target post with the trigger keyword.
        -   [ ] **Verification:** Did you receive the correct DM with the correct media on your test account?
        -   [ ] Does the activity show up on the dashboard after a short delay?

-   **[HUMAN] Task 4: Monitoring & Alerting Setup**
    -   **Action:** Configure who receives alerts.
    -   **Details:** While the code for logging exists (`logger.ts`), you need to configure your hosting or a third-party service (like Sentry, Datadog) to send an email or Slack notification when errors are logged in `logs/error.log` or when the bot's health check fails.

-   **[HUMAN] Task 5: Go Live**
    -   **Action:** If all the above steps are successful, the system is fully operational and ready for real users. You can now publicly announce the posts and keywords for your campaigns.
