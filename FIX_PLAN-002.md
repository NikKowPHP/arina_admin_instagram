# Emergency Fix Plan for Signal File Issue

## Critical Issue
NEEDS_ASSISTANCE.md file is present but cannot be accessed or deleted. This indicates a filesystem-level issue.

## Resolution Steps
1. Verify file existence using system tools
2. Force delete the file if it exists
3. If file doesn't exist, update system state to reflect reality
4. Implement filesystem health check

## Verification
- Confirm signals directory contains only valid system files
- Ensure all signal files are accessible
