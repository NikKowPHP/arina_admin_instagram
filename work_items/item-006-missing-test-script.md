# Missing Verification Test Script

## Issue
The `scripts/run_audit.sh` file specified in the audit plan does not exist. This script is crucial for automated verification of the system against the canonical spec.

## Required Actions
1. Create `scripts/` directory
2. Implement `run_audit.sh` with:
   - Placeholder code checks
   - Feature verification tests
   - Exit codes for CI/CD integration
3. Add execute permissions
4. Update documentation

## Implementation Notes
- Should integrate with existing CI/CD pipeline
- Must handle both success and failure cases clearly
- Should output JSON-formatted results for tooling consumption
