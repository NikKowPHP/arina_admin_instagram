# Audit Failure Report: System Incompleteness

## Identified Gaps Between Specification and Implementation

### 1. Testing Infrastructure Failure
- **Specification Requirement:** Full test coverage for all components
- **Current State:** pytest execution fails due to missing pytest-cov dependency
- **Impact:** Unable to verify core functionality meets requirements

### 2. Docker Build Failures
- **Specification Requirement:** Fully functional local Docker environment
- **Current State:** Admin panel fails to build due to:
  - Missing '@/bot-monitor/service' module
  - Incorrect React hook usage in Next.js components
  - Invalid 'import'/'export' syntax in API routes
- **Impact:** System cannot be deployed or tested as a whole

### 3. Next.js Component Issues
- **Specification Requirement:** Stable admin panel with proper client/server separation
- **Current State:** Multiple components incorrectly use React hooks without 'use client' directive
- **Impact:** Broken admin panel functionality and poor error handling

## Required Actions
1. Add pytest-cov to requirements.txt and ensure test suite runs
2. Fix Docker build errors in admin panel
3. Correct React hook usage in Next.js components
4. Verify full system functionality in Docker environment
