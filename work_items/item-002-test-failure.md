# Work Item 002: Test Execution Failure

**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Open  
**Assigned To:** DevOps Team  

## Audit Finding
Unable to execute tests due to environment configuration issues:
- Python interpreter not found in PATH
- pytest package not installed
- Missing test dependencies

## Required Actions
1. Set up proper Python environment with virtualenv/venv
2. Install pytest and all required testing dependencies
3. Ensure all tests are runnable from the project root
4. Document environment setup process in `docs/testing_environment.md`

## Implementation Notes
- Update CI/CD pipeline to include test environment setup
- Add verification step to ensure tests can be executed
- Include Python/pytest version requirements in documentation
