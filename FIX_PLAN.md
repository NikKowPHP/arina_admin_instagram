# Fix Plan for Architecture Map Verification

## Steps to Resolve

1. **Review Architecture Map**
   - Verify all features in `docs/architecture_map.md` match the `project_manifest.json` architectural_map
   - Confirm file paths for each feature are accurate

2. **Unblock Features**
   - Update status in `docs/architecture_map.md` from `[BLOCKED]` to `[ ]` for:
     - Authentication
     - Trigger Management
     - Template Management
     - Bot Service
     - Dashboard

3. **Validation Check**
   - Ensure all critical files exist and are accessible
   - Confirm task files in `work_breakdown/tasks/` align with feature implementations

4. **Handoff Preparation**
   - Developer AI should resume normal operation after map verification
